\title{Register Custom NIMBLE Distributions}
\usage{
register_nimble_distributions()
}
\value{
Invisible TRUE if successful
}
\description{
Registers the custom multivariate non-central hypergeometric distribution
for use in NIMBLE models. This function is called automatically when needed.
}
\note{
This function intentionally assigns to the global environment
(.GlobalEnv) as required by NIMBLE's compilation process. NIMBLE cannot
access package environments during compilation, so custom distributions
must be globally accessible.
}
