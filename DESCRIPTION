Description: Implements atom-based regression models (ABRM) for analyzing spatially 
    misaligned data. Provides functions for simulating misaligned spatial data, 
    preparing NIMBLE model inputs, running MCMC diagnostics, and comparing different 
    spatial analysis methods including dasymetric mapping.
